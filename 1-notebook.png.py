# ## Arithmetic Expression Examples
# In this section, we will demonstrate basic arithmetic operations such as addition and multiplication.
# 

# # Multiplication and Addition
# a = 5
# b = 10
# result = (a * b) + a
# result
# 

# # Convert minutes to hours
# def convert_minutes_to_hours(minutes):
#     hours = minutes / 60
#     return hours
# 
# convert_minutes_to_hours(120)  # Example: 120 minutes
# 

# ## Objectives
# - Understand basic data science languages and libraries.
# - Learn about various tools used in data science.
# - Perform basic arithmetic operations programmatically.
